	abstract = {Infrared (IR) cameras based on microbolometer focal plane arrays (FPAs) are the most widely used cameras in thermography. New fields of applications like handheld devices and small distributed sensors benefit from the latest sensor improvements in terms of cost and size reduction. In order to compensate for disturbing influences derived from changing ambient conditions, radiometric cameras use an optical shutter for online recalibration purposes, partially also together with sensor temperature stabilization. For these new applications, IR cameras should consist only of infrared optics, a sensor array, and digital signal processing (DSP). For acceptable measurement uncertainty values without using an optical shutter (shutter-less), the disturbing influences of changing thermal conditions have to be treated based on temperature measurements of the camera interior. We propose a compensation approach based on calibration measurements under controlled ambient conditions. All correction parameters are determined during the calibration process. Without sensor temperature stabilization (TEC-less), the pixel responsivity is also affected by the camera temperature changes and has to be considered separately. This paper presents the details of the compensation procedure and discusses relevant aspects to gain low temperature measurement uncertainty. The residual measurement uncertainty values are compared to the shutter-based compensation approach.},

	abstract = {Raw output data from image sensors tends to exhibit a form of bias due to slight on-die variations between photodetectors, as well as between ampliﬁers. The resulting bias, called ﬁxed pattern noise (FPN), is often corrected by subtracting its value, estimated through calibration, from the sensor’s raw signal. This paper introduces an on-line scene-based technique for an improved ﬁxed-pattern noise compensation which does not rely on calibration, and hence is more robust to the dynamic changes in the FPN which may occur slowly over time. This article ﬁrst gives a quick summary of existing FPN correction methods and explains how our approach relates to them. Three different pipeline architectures for realtime implementation on a FPGA-based smart camera are then discussed. For each of them, FPGA implementations details, performance and hardware costs are provided. Experimental results on a set of seven different scenes are also depicted showing that the proposed correction chain induces little additional resource use while guarantying high quality images on a wide variety of scenes.},

	abstract = {Non-uniformity in the response of spectral image elements is an inevitable phenomenon in hyperspectral imaging, which mainly manifests itself as the presence of band noise in the acquired hyperspectral data. This problem is prominent in the infrared band owing to the detector material, operating environment, and other factors. Non-uniformity is an important factor that can affect the quality of the hyperspectral data, which has a serious impact on both data analysis and applications and requires corrections via technical means wherever possible. This paper proposes a novel target-based non-uniformity self-correction method for infrared push-broom hyperspectral images. The Mars Mineralogical Spectrometer (MMS) onboard the Tianwen-1 orbiter was used as the research and application object. The model is constructed and applied to the target scene characteristics and detection patterns of Mars remote sensing exploration, which are combined with the causes of noise generation in the infrared spectral image bands. The design of the MMS dual-channel Visible-Near-Infrared (V-NIR) and Near-Mid-Infrared (N-MIR) co-field of view co-target detection and laboratory calibration data for the V-NIR spectral band can achieve non-uniformity corrections (NUCs). Therefore, for the MMS in-orbit Mars exploration mission, the method selected spectral data (920–1055 nm) characterized by a reduced atmospheric influence to iteratively obtain the homogeneous region, which was used to calculate the non-uniformity correction factor for the N-MIR spectral band. This method was compared, validated, and evaluated with other conventional methods using both laboratory and in-orbit hyperspectral data. The results showed that the experimental data corrections were comparable to laboratory calibrations, with a maximum relative deviation of {\textless}2.6\%. These results prove that our method not only provides an excellent non-uniformity correction, but also ensures spectral fidelity. It can thus be used as a non-uniformity correction process for the MMS and similar hyperspectral imagers.},

The two-point nonuniformity correction (NUC) method based on blackbody calibration performs a less than very satisfactory result to correct the sky scene with gradient gray distribution. Aiming at this problem, a new NUC method based on gradient scene calibration is proposed. First, the correction models are deduced in theory with the reference of the blackbody and the gradient scene. Then the pure sky images at the two different pitch angles are used as two reference temperature points to obtain the gain and offset coefficients by two-point correction. Next, two correction coefficients are filtered to remove residual noise. Finally, an outfield experiment with the proof-of-concept camera is performed. Experimental results show that the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of the point target image corrected by the proposed method is increased from 5.56 to 9.84 compared with the blackbody calibration-based NUC. And it has the preference of low complexity and easy implementation in the real-time system.},

This paper shows a technique to improve the convergence in accelerated way for CS (AACS: Acceleration Algorithm for Constant Statistics). The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by using simulated infrared video sequences and several real infrared video sequences obtained using two infrared cameras.},

It is shown that on the assumption of the additive nature of the fixed pattern noise, the frame-to-frame accumulation of such noise by analogy with the radar problem of detecting a signal against a correlated clutter can successfully compensate for it with a video sequence of more than 500 frames. During experiments with the Xenics Bobcat 640 short-wave infrared and Xenics Goby 384 long-wave infrared cameras it was demonstrated that in contrast to the well-known non-uniformity correction algorithm for a single frame, typical for it halo artifacts near extended scene objects are not observed in the resulting image, when fixed pattern noise is estimated from the results of accumulation over a set of frames.},

High-frequency FPN can be signiﬁcantly reduced by the recent scene based NUC algorithms. However, low-frequency FPN caused by stray light, optical effects, heat dissipation and so forth, is commonly compensated by calibration based NUC methods. In this work, we aim to reduce both the low-frequency and high frequency components of FPN by using an efﬁcient combination of registration based and constant statistics based approaches. We exploit scene variations through the video sequence and ﬁnd the underlying low-frequency noise by smartly averaging frames based on their motion and detail content. Thus, we add the generalization power of constant statistics approach to existing scene-based NUC methods to obtain lower FPN in both high-frequency and lowfrequency components. The performance of the proposed method is experimented on a public dataset corrupted by real FPN and evaluated by PSNR metric in comparison to a state-of-the-art scene-based NUC method.},

In addition, the proposed method doesn't make any assumption on the kind or amount of non-uniformity presented on the raw data. The strength and robustness of the proposed method relies in avoiding the presence of ghosting artifacts through the use of optimization techniques in the parameter estimation learning process, such as: momentum, regularization, and adaptive learning rate. The proposed method has been tested with video sequences of simulated and real infrared data taken with an InSb IRFPA, reaching high correction levels, reducing the fixed pattern noise, decreasing the ghosting, and obtaining an effective frame by frame adaptive estimation of each detector's gain and offset.},

Many systems, particularly those containing infrared focal plane array (FPA) sensors, are also subject to detector nonuniformity. Nonuniformity, or fixed pattern noise, results from nonuniform responsivity of the photodetectors that make up the FPA. Here we propose a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework for simultaneously addressing undersampling, linear blur, additive noise, and bias nonuniformity. In particular, we jointly estimate a superresolution (SR) image and detector bias nonuniformity parameters from a sequence of observed frames. This algorithm can be applied to video in a variety of ways including using a moving temporal window of frames to process successive groups of frames. By combining SR and nonuniformity correction (NUC) in this fashion, we demonstrate that superior results are possible compared with the more conventional approach of performing scene-based NUC followed by independent SR. The proposed MAP algorithm can be applied with or without SR, depending on the application and computational resources available. Even without SR, we believe that the proposed algorithm represents a novel and promising scene-based NUC technique. We present a number of experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. These include simulated imagery for quantitative analysis and real infrared video for qualitative analysis.},

	abstract = {Non-uniformity commonly exists in the infrared focal plane, which behaves as the fixed pattern noise (FPN) and seriously affects the image quality of the infrared imaging system. This paper proposed a novel scene-based non-uniformity correction method with a new edge-preserve filter and adaptive learning rate. First, using co-occurrence filter as the desired image estimation, the proposed method removed the FPN while preserving the image details. Then, an adaptive learning rate connected with both temporal motion and spatial correlation factor is utilized to decrease the effect of ghosting artifacts. In this way, the proposed method overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional scene-based non-uniformity. Several real infrared image sequences collected in different conditions are used to verify the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has a much better visual effect, making a great balance between the non-uniformity correction and details preservation. Compared with other good NUC methods, this method also has better performance in the aspects of applicability and robustness, which has great application value.},
